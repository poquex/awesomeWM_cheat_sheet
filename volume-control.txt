There are two main ways of doing volumen control, the first one is by spawning a volumen manager on the rc.lua and the second one is by inside of the theme or rc specifing a key to execute a command that changes volumen on x percentage and
then having a widget that checks the value of the audio manager and displays it.

method 1
programs that might use:
volumeicon



metod 2 (the key in rc.lua and command one):

you first need to check for the key keycode to use, after this, considering you are using pipewire, the command would be:


  ==== try this block at the end of the awful.key lines of rc.lua, usually works out of the box ========

  
  awful.key(
    { }, "XF86AudioLowerVolume",
    function() 
        awful.spawn("pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -5%")
    end,
    {description = "lower volume", group = "system"}),
awful.key(
    { }, "XF86AudioRaiseVolume",
    function()
        awful.spawn("pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +5%")
    end,
    {description = "increase volume", group = "system"}),


    ==== try this block at the end of the awful.key lines of rc.lua, usually works out of the box ========

      
      where "XF86AudioLowerVolume" and "XF86AudioRaiseVolume" are the keys and "pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +5%"
      si the command to do (in this case up volumen by %5).
