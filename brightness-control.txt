In the globalkeys = awful.util.table.join( section of ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua:

    -- Brightness

    awful.key({ }, "XF86MonBrightnessDown", function ()
        awful.util.spawn("xbacklight -dec 15") end),
    awful.key({ }, "XF86MonBrightnessUp", function ()
        awful.util.spawn("xbacklight -inc 15") end),


    (this solution needs xbacklight)


Also it can be use the command of sudo pacman -Sy brightnessctl

 brightnessctl set 3%+ increase by 3%

brightnessctl set 3%- decrease by 3%
